## Getting Started (Installation & Setup)

### Prerequisites:

- Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system. You can check by running `node -v` and `npm -v` (or `yarn -v`) in your terminal.
- A code editor of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text).

### Installation:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YBC2204/Bricstoken.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```sh
   cd Bricstoken
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   This project uses React for the frontend and Node.js with Stellar SDK for the backend. Install all dependencies by running:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration (Optional):

- **(Backend - Node.js):** You might need to configure your Stellar network details (Horizon server URL, network passphrase) in a separate configuration file for the Node.js backend. Refer to the Stellar documentation for details on setting up a Horizon server and network: [Stellar Documentation](https://developers.stellar.org/docs)

### Running the Project:

1. **Start the Backend Server:**

   ```sh
   cd backend
   npm i  
   node server.js
   ```

2. **Start the React Development Server:**

   ```sh
   cd brics
   npm i
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will typically start the React development server on `http://localhost:5173` (you might need to adjust the port based on your configuration). You can then access your BRICS Pay application in your web browser.
