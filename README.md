BRICS Pay: A Proposed International Payment System for BRICS Economies

BRICS Pay is a proposed payment system designed for member countries of the BRICS economic bloc (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa). It aims to facilitate international trade and transactions between them, reducing reliance on the US dollar and current messaging systems like SWIFT.

Features

BRICS Pay offers a variety of features designed to make cross-border transactions within BRICS countries secure, convenient, and cost-effective.

1. Easy Wallet Creation:

Users can create a BRICS Pay wallet using only their email address, eliminating the need for technical knowledge about digital wallets.

2. BRICS Token as Universal Currency:

BRICS Pay utilizes a unique token that can be used for transactions across all BRICS member countries. This eliminates the need for currency conversions and simplifies international trade.

3. Low Transaction Fees:

BRICS Pay is designed to offer near-zero gas fees for transactions, making it a cost-effective alternative to traditional payment methods.

4. Investment Opportunities:

Users can invest in company stocks and other assets from different BRICS countries directly through the BRICS Pay platform, fostering regional investment opportunities.

5. Token Swapping:

BRICS Pay allows users to easily swap their BRICS tokens for other supported tokens within the platform, providing greater flexibility for managing their digital assets.

6. Real-time Balance Tracking:

Users can view their BRICS Pay wallet balance in real-time, offering complete transparency and control over their finances.

7. Seamless User-to-User Transactions:

BRICS Pay facilitates instant and secure transfers between users within the BRICS network, promoting convenient peer-to-peer transactions.


## Getting Started (Installation & Setup)

Prerequisites:

* Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system. You can check by running node -v and npm -v (or yarn -v) in your terminal.
* A code editor of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text).

Installation:

1. Clone the Repository:

      git clone https://github.com/YBC2204/Bricstoken.git
   

2. Navigate to the project directory:

      cd Bricstoken
   

3. Install Dependencies:

   This project uses React for the frontend and Node.js with Stellar SDK for the backend. Install all dependencies by running:

      npm install
   

Configuration (Optional):

*  (Backend - Node.js): You might need to configure your Stellar network details (Horizon server URL, network passphrase) in a separate configuration file for the Node.js backend. Refer to the Stellar documentation for details on setting up a Horizon server and network: [https://developers.stellar.org/docs](https://developers.stellar.org/docs)

Running the Project:

1. Start the Backend Server:

   cd backend
   npm i  
   node server.js
   

2. Start the React Development Server:
      
      cd brics
      npm i
      npm run dev
   

This will typically start the React development server on http://localhost:5173 (you might need to adjust the port based on your configuration). You can then access your BRICS Pay application in your web browser.

Note:

* This is a general guide for a React project with a Node.js backend using Stellar SDK. The specific commands and configuration steps might vary depending on your project's specific implementation.
* Refer to the project codebase for more detailed instructions or comments within the code.
